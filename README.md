# Python-pygame-animation-for-beginners
This is a simple project to show how a simple animation is created in pygame. Please leave comments for more and to start releasing youtube videos.
python pygame animation might be a bit tedious to beginners in pygame
but this code written has made it much simpler

#just create an array containing the images that make up the animation that you want to create
#next all you have to do is to keep swapping the pictures with the next one until it gets to the last image 
#when it gets to the last image you replace the surface you are animating with the first one
#this can continue to give a very smooth animation
#but you should note that pygame is pretty slow for game development compared to other game engines so tons of images to swap may cause lags on less potent machines

#kindly share this code to others who might need support
